# sample for taking in input and printing to the console

# Adding int takes the input as an integer rather than string
age = int(input("What is your age? "))
# print(age)
# Preferable way to print
print (f"Your age is {age}")

# print ("Your age is", age) this would also work but use the above format

name = input("What is your name? ")
# print(name)
print ("Your name is", name)
