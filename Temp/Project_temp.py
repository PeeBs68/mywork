#Temp file for working on stuff related to the project

#Project Plan: maybe like this???
#Goals - It might help to suppose that your manager has asked you to investigate the data set, 
#with a view to explaining it to your colleagues. Imagine that you are to give a presentation on 
#the data set in a few weeksâ€™ time, where you explain what investigating a data set entails and 
#how Python can be used to do it
#Objectives - 
#Tasks - ???
#Probably need to look at due dates etc also

#Task suggestions
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file, use statistical analysis - mean, max, min etc.
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate
